## What the site is

The public website for **Embed Club**, an embedded-systems student club. It
exists so members can show what the club does and so students can find things:
upcoming events, past achievements, learning material, tools, member projects,
forms, certificates, and photos.

Every page is content-managed. Nothing that a club members might reasonably
want to change lives in JSX - it lives in Payload. Members are students, they
rotate yearly, and none of them should need a developer to add an event.

## Design language, in one paragraph

**"Solder & Copper"** - copper (`#d98e4a` dark / `#a05a20` light) on graphite
or warm white, with a fabric-of-squares texture on panels. Fonts are ITC Avant
Garde for body and Gobold + Sport Break for display. The signature UI object is
the **cutout card**: notched corners, an inset label strip, an image that zooms
on hover. Colors only ever come from CSS tokens. Full rules, including the list
of banned patterns, are in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) and AGENTS.md §1.

### A thing that looks like a bug and is not

Sidebar and mobile nav labels are plain ASCII and intentionally use the normal
words shown in the interface. Older versions used private-use Unicode
codepoints to select alternate font glyphs; that convention was removed and
must not be reintroduced.

## Content model

Admin nav is grouped so a new member can find things:

Notes on specific collections:

- **Resources / Tutorials / Simulators** are `orderable: true`.
  Drag rows in the admin list view; the site renders that order, top row first.
-  Projects use their own showcase arrangement and are not orderable.
- **Gallery** is an orderable upload collection - one document per photo,
  holding the file itself plus a caption. Drag many files onto the list view to
  bulk upload.
- **Forms** are authored directly in Payload as multi-step wizards. Payload is
  the source of truth; submissions can optionally be mirrored to Google Sheets.
- **Certificates** can be immediate or scheduled. Google Apps Script creates
  and emails PDFs from Google Slides templates, while Payload tracks status and
  retries.
- **Simulators** link out to someone else's site. Clicking a card opens a modal
  with an optional walkthrough video and a launch button, rather than
  navigating away immediately.
- **Users** cannot be created or deleted from the admin panel. Accounts are
  provisioned with `pnpm create:admin` (see below).

---

## Operational notes

### Adding an admin account

`users` has `create: () => false`, so the panel offers no "create user" button.
To add or reset one:

```bash
pnpm create:admin
```

Reads `BACKUP_ADMIN_EMAIL` and `BACKUP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the environment and
uses `overrideAccess: true` to bypass the lock. Never commit those values.

### Migrations

Schema is migration-managed. The workflow is in SETUP.md §4. Two cautions:

1. **Local `.env` points at the production database.** `pnpm build` runs
   migrations - use `pnpm build:app` for local verification builds.
2. `payload migrate:create` needs an interactive TTY and will ask
   create-vs-rename for every new enum and table. Recent migrations in this
   repo were hand-written, modelled on the existing DDL for a sibling
   collection. Whichever route you take, dry-run first: execute the `up` SQL
   inside a transaction and `ROLLBACK` before applying for real.

## Change history

### 2026-07-28 - Forms become the real thing

Forms stop mirroring a Google Form and become the system of record.
Migrations `20260728_140000` and `20260728_150000`.

**Google Forms dependency removed**

- `googleFormUrl` and every field's hand-copied `googleEntryId` are gone. That
  was the most error-prone step a member had, and Google answers `200` even
  when the entry IDs are wrong - so a typo silently sent responses nowhere and
  the old `googleForwardStatus` reported success regardless.
- Answers are keyed by each field row's Payload `id`, which survives label
  edits. `answersByLabel` keeps a copy against the wording at submit time so
  exports stay readable after questions are reworded.

**Certificates**

Two delivery modes on the form: _straight after they submit_, or _email
everyone at a set time_. Both are **rolling** - dispatch picks up whoever is
`pending` right now, so someone who submits the morning after the send time
still gets theirs on the next pass. Status is per recipient
(`pending`/`sent`/`failed` + `certificateError`), so a failure retries without
re-sending to people who already received one. There is deliberately no
review-before-send step: names are printed as typed.

**Generation and sending happen in Google Apps Script**, not on the site - see
`scripts/appsScript/certificateSender.gs`, which is committed here even though
it runs on Google's servers, so the next committee can find it.

The script copies a Google Slides template, replaces `{{name}}`, exports a PDF
and mails it with `GmailApp`. That sends **as the account that deployed the
script**, so certificates come from the club address with no SMTP host and no
app password. This matters: `pace.edu.in` is the college's Workspace tenant,
app passwords may well be disabled there, and we don't administer it.

The site keeps every decision - which form issues certificates, when they go
out, who already has one, what to retry - and POSTs one recipient at a time to
the web app, authenticated with a shared secret. Immediate sends go through
`after()` so a slow call never makes a student wait or costs them their
submission; scheduled sends go out from the `/api/cron/certificates` route,
guarded by `CRON_SECRET`, triggered every 15 minutes by a GitHub Actions
workflow (`.github/workflows/certificate-cron.yml`) rather than Vercel Cron -
the Hobby plan limits Vercel's own cron to once a day, too coarse for
same-day batches, and a hourly `vercel.json` cron block was silently failing
every deployment on that plan.

Each form can point at its own Slides template
(`certificateTemplateDriveId`); empty falls back to the script's default.

**Batches** - a scheduled form's certificates don't have to go out all at
once. `certificateBatches` is an array: each row names a batch, a question
(`matchField`), an expected answer (`matchValue`), and its own `sendAt`. A
submission is matched against these in order; if none match, it falls back to
the form's plain `certificateSendAt`. This is fully member-configurable -
any number of batches, matched on any question - not a fixed "Section A/B"
split.

**Wording** - `certificateNameCase` and `certificateEmailNameCase` are
independent per form (`asTyped` / `upper` / `title`), so a certificate can
print `RAFAN AHAMAD SHEIK` while the email greets `Dear Rafan Ahamad Sheik,` -
mirroring a prior manual workflow. `certificateEmailSubject` /
`certificateEmailBody` optionally override the default message, with
`{{name}}`/`{{event}}` placeholders resolved on the site before the request
reaches Apps Script - the script itself never sees a template, only the
final strings.

The Apps Script's secret and default template id live in **Script
Properties**, not in the committed source - a literal secret in a file meant
for git would sit in history forever.

**Event ↔ form link reversed**

`events.registrationForm` is dropped in favour of `forms.relatedEvent`. Events
exist long before their forms do, so pointing the other way meant going back to
edit the event afterwards. Events surface theirs through a read-only `join`
field, which needs no column and cannot drift.

**Feedback**

The `feedback-page` global is gone. Feedback is now the Forms listing filtered
to `type: 'feedback'` - both pages share `formsListing.tsx` and the cutout
`formCutoutCard`.

**Hardening**

Honeypot field, per-form rate limit, and dedupe by email (a second submission
replaces the first, so nobody gets two certificates). Certificate forms now
refuse to save without exactly one `name` and one `email` role - caught at
edit time rather than at send time, when the event is already over.

**Optional Google Sheets mirror**

One spreadsheet **per form** (`forms.sheetId`, accepts a pasted URL). Because a
sheet holds a single form's responses, columns are that form's questions rather
than a JSON blob. Headers are matched by text and new questions are appended as
new columns, so editing a form cannot change what an older row's columns mean.
Idempotent - a row is only marked synced once written, and the submission id
leads every row. Auth is a service-account JWT signed with `node:crypto`, so no
Google SDK dependency. Entirely inert without credentials.

Before reaching for this: `form-submissions` is now wired into the
import/export plugin, so CSV/JSON export works from the admin list view with no
Google setup at all.

### 2026-07-28 - Admin cleanup and content-model overhaul

A five-part pass to make the admin panel navigable for non-technical member.
Migrations `20260728_100000` through `20260728_130000`.

**Removed**

- **Audio + Audio Files collections**, and the `audioSliderField` admin
  component. Nothing ever read them - the home page's background music is the
  static `/Home.m4a` asset played by `backgroundAudio.tsx`, which is untouched
  and still has its toggle. Both tables held zero rows.
- **Resources `featured` checkbox** - a dead field, rendered nowhere. The
  `badge` select (which does render, and includes a "Featured" option) stays.
- **Resources `type` select** - replaced by a real Tutorials collection.
- **Resources `lastUpdated` date** - "Last updated" now reads Payload's own
  `updatedAt`, so it cannot drift from reality.
- **Simulators `category`** - the search bar hides its category filter when a
  collection has none.

**Added**

- **Tutorials collection**, splitting what used to be `resources.type`.
  Identical document shape, so both are built from one field factory
  (`learningFields.ts`) over a shared block palette (`contentBlocks.ts`).
- **Projects collection** and `/projects` page - member builds, with a status
  (planned / in progress / completed), the team who made it, and links to
  source or a demo. Added to the sidebar and mobile nav.
- **Simulator modal** with video support. `simulatorVideo.tsx` normalizes
  YouTube, youtu.be, Shorts, and Vimeo links to embeds, and falls back to a
  `<video>` element for direct file links.
- **Manual ordering** on Resources, Tutorials, Simulators, Projects, Gallery.
- **Description length caps** (200 chars) on Resources, Tutorials, Simulators,
  Projects, and the Events card tagline - the UI clamps to two lines.
- **`pnpm create:admin`** script, and the user-creation lockdown it exists for.

**Changed**

- **Gallery** went from one document holding an array of Media picks to an
  upload collection, one document per photo. This is what makes bulk upload
  possible. The 32 existing photos migrated by copying their Media rows' upload
  columns; because gallery shares the bucket root and image sizes with `media`,
  the already-generated derivative files still resolve and nothing was
  re-uploaded. **Consequence:** a migrated gallery document and its original
  Media document point at the same object in the bucket - deleting one deletes
  the shared file.
- **Simulator cards** moved onto the cutout design, matching resources.
- **Events carousel card** moved onto the cutout design - it was the last
  holdout, using `rounded-3xl` (which also broke the "no radius > 16px on
  cards" rule in AGENTS.md §1), a pill "New" badge, and a gradient title
  overlay instead of the notched inset strip.
- **Simulator slugs** auto-generate and are read-only.
- `iframeUrl` → `launchUrl` on Simulators; simulators are launched, not embedded.

**Known gaps after this pass**

- The one existing Wokwi simulator has no `launchUrl` (its old `iframeUrl` was
  null). The modal shows a "no link yet" message until an organizer adds one.
- Every card surface is now on the cutout system. `FocusCards` (events grid)
  and `ChromaGrid` (Members) already were - they compose `CutoutCorner` and the
  notched inset label directly rather than importing the full `CutoutCard`
  root, which makes it easy to misread the imports and think otherwise.
- Forms and Feedback were deliberately deferred: the plan is to build forms in
  the CMS and push them to Google Forms, rather than mirroring a Google Form by
  hand. `form-submissions` (0 rows) is slated for removal, which needs
  AGENTS.md §3 updated first - that rule currently forbids it.
