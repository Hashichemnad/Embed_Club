/**
 * Fill in "How to use" steps and the button label for every simulator.
 *
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/seedSimulatorGuides.ts
 *
 * Two things per tool: whether the main button reads "Open Website" or
 * "Download App", and a short numbered guide shown under the video in the
 * modal. Steps are deliberately short - enough to get a student from a cold
 * start to something running, not a manual.
 *
 * Walkthrough videos are left alone. A video URL has to be a real one someone
 * has watched, so those get added by hand in the admin rather than guessed at
 * here.
 *
 * Matched on slug. Re-running overwrites the guide, so edit in the admin once
 * A member has improved the wording.
