/**
 * "On this page" nav with a scroll-linked progress rail.
 *
 * Active tracking is position-based - the last heading scrolled past the
 * ACTIVE_LINE_RATIO line wins - rather than IntersectionObserver. Observers report each
 * heading independently, so two headings close together (a short section, or a
 * heading sitting right above a table's own header row) are both "intersecting"
 * and the active item flickers between them. Asking "which heading did I most
 * recently pass?" has exactly one answer at any scroll position, so it cannot
 * flicker regardless of how tightly headings are packed.
 *
 * Anchor ids come from `lib/richTextHeadings`, which also feeds the renderer,
 * so the links and the headings can't drift apart.
 *
 * The moving parts - bar width, percentage, rail height, node fills - are
 * written straight to the DOM from the scroll handler rather than held in
 * state. Routing them through `setState` re-rendered the whole nav on every
 * frame, and React schedules those renders on a task the browser happily
 * defers while a scroll gesture is in flight: the rail visibly froze mid-scroll
 * and snapped to the right value once the wheel stopped. Only `activeId` is
 * state, because it changes a handful of times per page rather than per frame.
 *
 * The rail height and node fills track `currentIndex`, interpolated against
 * the next heading's position - not the raw scroll `progress` the bar above
 * the nav uses. Sections vary wildly in length (a step with three screenshots
 * vs. one line of text), so raw scroll percentage and "which item is active"
 * disagree constantly; the interpolation is what makes the fill move smoothly
 * (like the achievements timeline's bar) while still landing on the same item
 * `activeId` highlights, instead of racing ahead of or lagging behind it.
