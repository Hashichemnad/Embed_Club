/**
 * Google Drive is where files that *respondents* attach to a form are kept -
 * deliberately not the S3/Supabase bucket the site's own media lives in.
 *
 * The reasoning: member-authored images are site content and belong in the
 * `form-media` collection, but respondent uploads are unvetted third-party
 * files whose volume follows however many people fill the form in. Keeping
 * them in a Drive folder the club already owns means storage is somebody
 * else's problem, and members can open the folder directly.
 *
 * Each form carries its own `driveFolderId`; `GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` is the
 * fallback for forms that set none. The folder has to be reachable by whoever
 * the site is authorised as - in practice, owned by that account.
 *
 * A service account has no storage quota of its own, and Drive refuses any
 * write where the new file would end up owned by one - every upload 403s with
 * "Service Accounts do not have storage quota". So the file needs a real
 * owner. Two ways, and the first is what this site uses:
 *
 *   1. **The club account's own OAuth refresh token**
 *      (`GOOGLE_DRIVE_REFRESH_TOKEN`, minted by `pnpm drive:auth`). That
 *      account consents once, to itself, and uploads are owned by it. The
 *      credential reaches exactly one Drive and nothing else.
 *
 *   2. **A Shared Drive folder**, where files are owned by the drive rather
 *      than any person, with the service account as a Content Manager - hence
 *      `supportsAllDrives` on every call. Needs a Workspace edition that
 *      includes Shared Drives, which pace.edu.in's does not.
 *
 * Domain-wide delegation is the third way the internet will suggest. It works,
 * but it lets this service account act as *any* account in the domain for
 * Drive - a college-wide capability created to solve a club-website problem -
 * and it needs a Workspace admin. Deliberately not used.
