/**
 * Collapsible sections, for a page that is several self-contained parts rather
 * than one continuous read.
 *
 * Built on native `<details>` / `<summary>` rather than state and a click
 * handler. That gets keyboard support, the correct ARIA semantics, and
 * in-page search ("find on page" opens a closed section in current browsers)
 * for free - none of which a div-and-onClick version has unless it is written,
 * and it usually is not. It also means this stays a server component, so the
 * blocks inside it can be server components too.
 *
 * No `name` attribute on the details elements: that would make them exclusive,
 * and a reader comparing two sessions should be able to open both.
