 * Deliberately not inside `formCutoutCard.tsx`: that file is `'use client'`,

 * render. Next allows a server component to *render* a client component, but
 * not to *call* a function exported from a client module - doing so fails the
 * production build with "Attempted to call formToCard() from the server".
 *
 * That went unnoticed for a while because `forms.map(formToCard)` never
 * executes when the query returns no rows, so the build only broke once a form
 * actually existed.
