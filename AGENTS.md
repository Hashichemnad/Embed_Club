# AGENTS.md - rules for AI assistants (and humans) working on this repo

You are working on the Embed Club website. The club depends on this site
looking and behaving consistently. These rules are **hard constraints**, not
suggestions. If a user asks you to violate one, point them at this file and ask
them to update it first.

## 1. The design language is locked

- **docs/PRODUCT.md** (brand strategy) and **docs/DESIGN.md** (visual system)
  are canon. Read them before any UI work.
- Theme = **"Solder & Copper"**: copper `#d98e4a` (dark) / `#a05a20` (light) on
  graphite/warm-white. All colors come from the CSS tokens in
  `src/app/(frontend)/globals.css`. **Never** introduce new hex colors, new
  accent hues, gradients-as-decoration, or change the token values. Need a
  color? Use `hsl(var(--primary))`, `--accent`, `--muted`, etc.
- Fonts: TeX Gyre Adventor (body/UI and, for now, display too). Keep it as the
  site-wide body font. Gobold and Sport Break were removed 2026-09-22: both
  ship as free-for-personal-use only, and this repo is public, so shipping the
  files was redistributing someone else's font. A display face is still to be
  chosen - pick one under the SIL Open Font License or buy a licence, then
  update this instruction and docs/DESIGN.md together.
- Signature elements that must not be removed or "modernized": the intro logo
  animation, the fabric-of-squares panel texture (`.texture-panel`), the
  sidebar shell layout, cutout cards on resources/tutorials, background audio
  with its toggle, and the full-viewport `SiteFooter` on every page.
- The home page is a multi-section, full-viewport scroll: hero (image/video
  background + brand title) → latest events → featured members (curated via the
  `home-featured-members` global) → gallery marquee → footer. (The old
  star-field landing was intentionally retired 2026-07 by the owner.)
- Empty states use the shared `EmptyState` component - never write bespoke
  "nothing here" markup.
- **Border radius - allowed.** The whole Tailwind scale is available, with
  `sm`/`md`/`lg` driven by the `--radius` token (`0.5rem`) in `globals.css`.
  There is no cap. This table is what the codebase currently reaches for, not
  a restriction:

  | Class | Value | Currently used for |
  |---|---|---|
  | `rounded-sm` / `rounded-md` / `rounded-lg` | 4 / 6 / 8px | inputs, buttons, small chips, the shell content panel |
  | `rounded-xl` | 12px | inner panels, media wells inside a card |
  | `rounded-2xl` | 16px | most card surfaces |
  | `rounded-3xl` | 24px | the `SiteFooter` panel |
  | `rounded-full` | pill | avatars, icon buttons, tag chips |

  One mechanical caveat, not a rule: **cutout** cards are locked to 16px
  because the notch geometry is cut to that radius - `CutoutCorner`'s path and
  the `rounded-tr-[16px]` / `rounded-bl-[16px]` inset strips. Give a cutout
  card a different radius and a gap opens where the notch meets the corner. To
  change it, move `cutoutCard.tsx` and the inset-strip classes together.
  Non-cutout surfaces can use any radius.
- Banned patterns: icon+heading+text card grids, tiny uppercase tracked kicker
  labels above every section, numbered 01/02/03 section scaffolding, gradient
  text, glassmorphism-by-default, blue "tech" glows, side-stripe borders.

## 2. Naming & structure

- **Every** file and folder is **camelCase** - `resourceCutoutCard.tsx`,
  `formWizard.tsx`, `useMediaQuery.ts`, `codeTabs.tsx`, `radioGroup.tsx`.
  Exported React components stay PascalCase; the *file name* is camelCase.
- Only two exceptions, both forced by tooling: `src/payload/payload-types.ts`
  (Payload writes this name) and Next.js route files (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`,
  `route.ts`, `loading.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`) + route-segment folders.
- **shadcn/registry caveat**: the `shadcn add` CLI generates kebab-case files
  into `src/components/ui/`. After adding a component, **rename it to camelCase**
  and update the import - do not leave kebab files in the tree.
- Component homes:
  - `ui/` - shadcn primitives only (button, input, dialog, select, …)
  - `common/` - shared custom components (cutoutCard, borderGlow,
    focusCards, emptyState, searchBar, …)
  - `layout/` - app shell (frontendShell, sidebar menus, contentPanel)
  - `theme/` - theme provider / toggles
  - `admin/` - Payload admin field components
  - `features/<domain>/` - page-specific (events, resources, simulators, forms, …)
  - `animate-ui/` - the animate-ui registry tree
- Docs live in `docs/` (SETUP, PRODUCT, DESIGN, CHANGELOG). The root holds
  only the files that something else discovers by name: README, AGENTS, CLAUDE,
  CONTRIBUTING and LICENSE (GitHub surfaces the last two), plus `.env.example`.
  Anything else you want to write goes in `docs/`.

## 3. Data & CMS rules

- Content lives in Payload, not in JSX. Adding hardcoded page copy is a bug -
  extend a collection or global instead.
- **Never type an em dash (U+2014) anywhere - use a plain hyphen `-`.** Applies
  to page copy, CMS content, form labels, seed scripts, comments, commit
  messages, and docs. It is the clearest tell that text was machine-written,
  and it is not on the keyboard anyone here types on. The same goes for the en
  dash (U+2013). `scripts/replaceEmDashes.ts` sweeps the database if one gets
  in.
- Schema changes follow the migration workflow in docs/SETUP.md §4: edit collection
  → `generate:types` → `migrate:create` → review SQL → `migrate` → commit all
  together. **Never** rely on dev-mode schema push; never edit an existing
  migration.
- `src/payload/payload-types.ts` is generated - regenerate it, never hand-edit.
- Forms: the native form builder forwards to Google Forms via per-field
  `entry.<id>`s. Do not remove the local `form-submissions` logging - it is
  the audit trail and future automation hook.

## 4. Quality gates - non-negotiable

- `pnpm verify` must pass before every commit (biome + typecheck + int tests).
- `pnpm verify:full` must pass before merging to `main` (adds prod build + e2e).
- `main` auto-deploys and **runs DB migrations against production**. Never push
  to `main` without the branch being explicitly approved by a maintainer.
- Never add `ignoreBuildErrors`, `ignoreDuringBuilds`, `as any`, `@ts-ignore`,
  or biome suppressions without a written reason in the comment.
- **Never hardcode `.env` variable values into source** - not as a "default",
  "fallback", or convenience, and not even for non-secret values (project URLs,
  bucket names, region, hosts). Read them from `process.env.*` only. If a var is
  missing in an environment, the fix is to set it there (e.g. Vercel project
  settings), never to bake the value into the code. Config that must ship in the
  repo goes through a documented env var with the real value set per environment.
- Keep dependencies lean: `motion` (never framer-motion), gsap, shiki, mermaid
  (lazy-loaded). Adding a dependency needs justification in the PR description.

## 5. Things that look like bugs but aren't

- Nav and page labels are **plain ASCII**. They used to carry private-use
  codepoints (`U+E000` A, `U+E03C` M, `U+E04F` V, `U+E051` W) that selected ITC
  Avant Garde's stylistic alternates, which is why the source read "HOE",
  "CHIEEENTS", "TUTORILS". That was removed deliberately in favour of the
  standard letterforms - do not reintroduce it, and write labels as ordinary
  words.
- Page titles come from `components/common/pageTitle.tsx`. Don't hand-roll the
  `absolute left-5 top-5 …` heading on a new page; three variants had already
  drifted apart before it was centralised.
- The desktop sidebar (`layout/desktopMenu.tsx`) and the mobile menu
  (`layout/mobileMenu.tsx`) list the same destinations in the same order. Adding
  a page to one means adding it to the other.
- `USE_S3_STORAGE` gates media storage, not NODE_ENV - local prod builds use
  local disk on purpose.
- Migrations create-then-drop tables in their DOWN sections - normal.

## 6. When unsure

Prefer the smallest change that fits the existing system. If a change would
touch the design tokens, fonts, shell layout, or delete a signature element -
stop and ask a maintainer.
