/**
 * Seed the announced-but-unwritten board tutorials.
 *
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/seedComingSoonBoards.ts
 *
 * Both carry the `comingSoon` badge, which makes their cards render but not
 * link (see resourceCutoutCard.tsx) - the page exists so the announcement has
 * somewhere to live, and so the guide can be written into it later without a new
 * URL. Neither board is in the club's hands yet; the specs below are from the
 * manufacturers' announcements, and each page says so.
 *
 * Thumbnails use the shared placeholder graphic. Matched on slug, so re-running
 * updates in place. Live immediately.
