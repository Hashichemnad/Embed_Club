/**
 * Error boundary for every frontend route.
 *
 * The pages fetch through the Payload local API, so a database outage surfaces
 * as a thrown error rather than an empty result. Without this, Next falls back
 * to its own bare error screen; with it, an outage reads as an outage - and
 * `reset()` re-runs the failed render, which is usually all a transient Neon
 * blip needs.
 *
 * Deliberately not the shell (`SidebarShell`/`MainbarShell`): the boundary has
 * to render even when the failure is in the layout's own data, so it stays
 * self-contained and uses only theme tokens.
